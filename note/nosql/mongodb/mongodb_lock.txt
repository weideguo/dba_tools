MongoDB uses reader-writer locks that allow concurrent readers shared access to a resource, such as a database or collection.


a shared (S) locking mode for reads  
an exclusive (X) locking mode for write 
intent shared (IS) and intent exclusive (IX) modes indicate an intent to read or write a resource using a finer granularity lock. 
When locking at a certain granularity, all higher levels are locked using an intent lock.


For example, 
when locking a collection for writing (using mode X), 
both the corresponding 
database lock and the global lock 
must be locked in intent exclusive (IX) mode. 

A single database can simultaneously be locked in IS and IX mode, 
but an exclusive (X) lock cannot coexist with any other modes, 
and a shared (S) lock can only coexist with intent shared (IS) locks.
